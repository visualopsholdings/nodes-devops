# Installing CMake from source

## Ubuntu 24.04 

This has been tested:
- AWS T4G, T2

On a VM:

Copy over and run "cmake.sh" with scp/ssh.

If you are actually ON the machine where you want to run the script, check out
the project:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops
nodes-devops/dev/cmake.sh
```

On a macintosh you can just use:

```
brew install cmake
```
